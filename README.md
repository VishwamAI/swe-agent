# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Cybersecurity Agent

The Cybersecurity Agent is designed to autonomously learn and practice cybersecurity challenges across various platforms. It integrates data from the Exploit Database and simulates interactions with platforms like TryHackMe and picoCTF to enhance its knowledge and skills.

## Features

- Fetches and categorizes exploit data from the Exploit Database.
- Interactive learning and practice environment.
- Integration with TryHackMe and picoCTF for practical challenges.
- Documented learning process and solution verification using Google.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/Cyber-Security-agent.git
   cd Cyber-Security-agent
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

4. **Start the frontend server:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the web application:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the frontend.

2. **Fetch and process exploit data:**
   The backend server will fetch and categorize exploit data from the Exploit Database and serve it at the `/exploits` endpoint.

3. **Interact with the learning environment:**
   Use the web application to simulate interactions with cybersecurity platforms and practice challenges.
